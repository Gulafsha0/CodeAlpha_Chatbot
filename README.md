ðŸ“Œ Task 4: Basic Chatbot

ðŸ§  Goal:

Build a simple *rule-based chatbot* using Python. The chatbot takes user input and responds with predefined replies based on basic keyword matching.

ðŸ“‹ Scope

- Accepts input from the user such as:
  - "hello"
  - "how are you"
  - "bye"
- Responds with predefined replies like:
  - "Hi!"
  - "I'm fine, thanks!"
  - "Goodbye!"

ðŸ›  Key Concepts Used

- if-elif conditional statements  
- functions for modular code  
- loops for continuous interaction  
- input/output for user communication  

ðŸ’» How It Works

1. The chatbot starts a conversation with the user.
2. It waits for the user to type specific messages.
3. Based on the message, it returns a predefined response.
4. If the user types "bye", the chatbot ends the conversation.
